This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "An introduction to property based testing". 

Here's the blurb for the talk:


> We are all familiar with example-based testing, as typified by TDD and BDD. 
> Property-based testing takes a very different approach, where a single test is run hundreds of times with randomly generated inputs. 
> <br><br>
> Property-based testing is a great way to find edge cases, and also helps you to 
> understand and document the behaviour of your code under all conditions. 
> <br><br>
> This talk will introduce property-based testing and show how it works, 
> and why you should consider adding it to your arsenal of testing tools. 

This talk is based on my blog posts on this topic:

* [An introduction to property-based testing](/posts/property-based-testing/)
* [Choosing properties for property-based testing](/posts/property-based-testing-2/)
