This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Designing with Capabilities". 

Here's the blurb for the talk:


> We all want to produce modular and robust code that is easy to test and refactor, 
> and we have design principles such as SOLID that help us do that.
> <br><br>
> In this talk I'll look at a very different approach to design using "capabilities" 
> and the principle of least authority. I'll show how using these design techniques 
> throughout your core domain (and not just at your API boundary) also 
> leads to well-designed and modular code.
> <br><br>
> I'll demonstrate how to design and use a capability based approach, 
> how capabilities can be quickly combined and restricted easily, 
> and how capabilities are a natural fit with a REST API that uses HATEAOS.

This talk is based on my blog posts on this topic:

* [A functional approach to authorization](/posts/capability-based-security/)
* [Constraining capabilities based on identity and role](/posts/capability-based-security-2/)
* [Using types as access tokens](/posts/capability-based-security-3/)

Also related are the talk and posts on designing Enterprise Tic-Tac-Toe:

* [Enterprise Tic-Tac-Toe](/posts/enterprise-tic-tac-toe/)
* [Enterprise Tic-Tac-Toe Part 2, In which I throw away the previous design](/posts/enterprise-tic-tac-toe-2/)
* [Video and slides for my "Enterprise Tic-Tac-Toe" talk](/ettt/)
