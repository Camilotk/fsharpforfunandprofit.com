## Domain Modeling Made Functional (ebook and paper)

This book is a mix of Domain Driven Design, modeling with types, and an intro to functional programming with F# (composition, error handling, etc). It's a bit of an experiment, but AFAIK there is nothing else like it out there.

It does have some chapters on stuff I haven't blogged about (yet) such how to design a functional architecture, two whole chapters on serialization and persistence of algebraic types (important but not often covered in detail), and how to evolve an existing design.

You can get it [from the Pragmatic Programmers site](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional)
or order on [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Modeling-Made-Functional-Domain-Driven/dp/1680502549) or [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Modeling-Made-Functional-Domain-Driven/dp/1680502549). Also available from most other suppliers.
