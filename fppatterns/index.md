This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Functional Programming Design Patterns". 

Here's the blurb:

> In object-oriented development, we are all familiar with design patterns
> such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern, and design principles such as SOLID. 
> <br><br>
> The functional programming community has design patterns and principles as well. 
> <br><br>
> This talk will provide an overview of some of these, and present some 
> demonstrations of FP design in practice.

## Slides 

Here are the slides that I used at NDC London 2014:

There's also a [longer version of the slides](http://www.slideshare.net/ScottWlaschin/fp-patterns-ndc-london2014) as well.

## Videos
 
Below is the video recorded at NDC London 2014 (click image to view video). It's an hour long and I whiz through as fast as I can!

I did the same talk at the London F# Meetup in January, 2015. This time, there were questions during the talk, and I went a bit slower. As a result, it's about two hours long!

## Twitterstorm!

After I did this talk at BuildStuff 2014, one particular slide got retweeted a lot.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I love this slide from <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin">@ScottWlaschin</a> &#39;s talk on FP &quot;patterns&quot; <a href="http://t.co/8UuwVqlelD">pic.twitter.com/8UuwVqlelD</a></p>&mdash; Knot, Not Naught!

Alas, it got misinterpreted by both the pro-FP and anti-FP people!
 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/abt_programming">@abt_programming</a> this slide is an open-and-shut case of FP bigotry. <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin">@scottwlaschin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jeroldhaas">@jeroldhaas</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sgoguen">@sgoguen</a></p>&mdash; Yehuda Katz (@wycats) <a href="https://twitter.com/wycats/status/536737859466588161">November 24, 2014</a></blockquote>

Even Uncle Bob [wrote a post about it](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html)!

Oh dear! Humor doesn't work out of context. So in the NDC and Skills Matter version of the talk I decided to make it clearer that I was making fun of FP people who live in an ivory tower:

Hope you enjoy the talk!
