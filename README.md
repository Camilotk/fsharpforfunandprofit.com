## Contribution Guide

If you have a suggestion for a correction or an improvement, please let me know.

### Typos?

If you find a small typo in the text (not code), please send me a pull request and I will probably accept it with thanks!

### Large text changes?

If you want to suggest larger changes to the text, please do NOT create a PR. Instead, please create a GH issue so that we can discuss it first. I would hate to reject a PR that you worked on.

### Small code changes?

If you see a small bug in the code, for now, please fix as for typos.

I am in the process of moving all the code into separate files, and when that is done, I will be happy to accept PRs on those files.
