This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Four Languages From Forty Years Ago". 

Here's the blurb for the talk:

> The 1970's were a golden age for new programming languages, but do they have any relevance to programming today? Can we still learn from them? 
> <br><br>
> In this talk, we'll look at four languages designed over forty years ago -- SQL, Prolog, ML, and Smalltalk -- and discuss their philosophy and approach to programming, which is very different from most popular languages today. 
> <br><br>
> We'll come away with some practical principles that are still very applicable to modern development. And you might discover your new favorite programming paradigm!
