Although F# is great for specialist areas such as scientific or data analysis, it is also an excellent choice for enterprise development. Here are five good reasons why you should consider using F# for  your next project. 

<div class="row">  
    <div class="span4" style="float:right;">
<h2><img src="/assets/img/glyphicons/glyphicons_030_pencil.png" class="bs-icon"> Conciseness</h2>

<p>
F# is not cluttered up with <a href="/posts/fvsc-sum-of-squares/">coding "noise"</a> such as curly brackets, semicolons and so on. 
</p>
<p>
You almost never have to specify the type of an object, thanks to a powerful <a href="/posts/conciseness-type-inference/">type inference system</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And, compared with C#, it generally takes <a href="/posts/fvsc-download/">fewer lines of code</a> to solve the same problem.
</p>

	</div>

    <div class="span4" style="float:left;">

{% highlight fsharp %}
// one-liners
[1..100] |> List.sum |> printfn "sum=%d"

// no curly braces, semicolons or parentheses
let square x = x * x
let sq = square 42 

// simple types in one line
type Person = {First:string; Last:string}

// complex types in a few lines
type Employee = 
  | Worker of Person
  | Manager of Employee list

// type inference
let jdoe = {First="John";Last="Doe"}
let worker = Worker jdoe
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><img src="/assets/img/glyphicons/glyphicons_343_thumbs_up.png" class="bs-icon"> Convenience</h2>

<p>
Many common programming tasks are much simpler in F#.  This includes things like creating and using <a href="/posts/conciseness-type-definitions/">complex type definitions</a>, doing <a href="/posts/conciseness-extracting-boilerplate/">list processing</a>, <a href="/posts/convenience-types/">comparison and equality</a>, <a href="/posts/designing-with-types-representing-states/">state machines</a>, and much more. 
</p>
<p>
And because functions are first class objects, it is very easy to create powerful and reusable code by creating functions that have <a href="/posts/conciseness-extracting-boilerplate/">other functions as parameters</a>, or that <a href="/posts/conciseness-functions-as-building-blocks/">combine existing functions</a> to create new functionality. 
</p>


	</div>
    
    <div class="span4" style="float:left;">
{% highlight fsharp %}
// automatic equality and comparison
type Person = {First:string; Last:string}
let person1 = {First="john"; Last="Doe"}
let person2 = {First="john"; Last="Doe"}
printfn "Equal? %A"  (person1 = person2)

// easy IDisposable logic with "use" keyword
use reader = new StreamReader(..)

// easy composition of functions
let add2times3 = (+) 2 >> (*) 3
let result = add2times3 5
{% endhighlight %}

	</div>

</div>

<div class="row">  
    <div class="span4" style="float:right;">
<h2><img src="/assets/img/glyphicons/glyphicons_150_check.png" class="bs-icon"> Correctness</h2>

<p>
F# has a <a href="/posts/correctness-type-checking/">powerful type system</a> which prevents many common errors such as <a href="/posts/the-option-type/#option-is-not-null">null reference exceptions</a>.
</p>
<p>
Values are <a href="/posts/correctness-immutability/">immutable by default</a>, which prevents a large class of errors.
</p>
<p>
In addition, you can often encode business logic using the <a href="/posts/correctness-exhaustive-pattern-matching/">type system</a> itself in such a way that it is actually <a href="/posts/designing-for-correctness/">impossible to write incorrect code</a> or mix up <a href="/posts/units-of-measure/">units of measure</a>, greatly reducing the need for unit tests.   
</p>

	</div>

    <div class="span4" style="float:left;">
{% highlight fsharp %}
// strict type checking
printfn "print string %s" 123 //compile error

// all values immutable by default
person1.First <- "new name"  //assignment error 

// never have to check for nulls
let makeNewString str = 
   //str can always be appended to safely
   let newString = str + " new!"
   newString

// embed business logic into types
emptyShoppingCart.remove   // compile error!

// units of measure
let distance = 10<m> + 10<ft> // error!
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="row">  
    <div class="span4" style="float:right;">
<h2><img src="/assets/img/glyphicons/glyphicons_054_clock.png" class="bs-icon"> Concurrency</h2>

<p>
F# has a number of built-in libraries to help when more than one thing at a time is happening. Asynchronous programming is <a href="/posts/concurrency-async-and-parallel/">very easy</a>, as is parallelism. F# also has a built-in <a href="/posts/concurrency-actor-model/">actor model</a>, and excellent support for event handling and <a href="/posts/concurrency-reactive/">functional reactive programming</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And of course, because data structures are immutable by default, sharing state and avoiding locks is much easier.
</p>
	</div>

    <div class="span4" style="float:left;">
{% highlight fsharp %}
// easy async logic with "async" keyword
let! result = async {something}

// easy parallelism
Async.Parallel [ for i in 0..40 -> 
      async { return fib(i) } ]

// message queues
MailboxProcessor.Start(fun inbox-> async{
	let! msg = inbox.Receive()
	printfn "message is: %s" msg
	})
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><img src="/assets/img/glyphicons/glyphicons_280_settings.png" class="bs-icon"> Completeness</h2>

<p>
Although it is a functional language at heart, F# does support other styles which are not 100% pure, which makes it much easier to interact with the non-pure world of web sites, databases, other applications, and so on. In particular, F# is designed as a hybrid functional/OO language, so it can do <a href="/posts/completeness-anything-csharp-can-do/">virtually everything that C# can do</a>.  
</p>
<p>
Of course, F# is <a href="/posts/completeness-seamless-dotnet-interop/">part of the .NET ecosystem</a>, which gives you seamless access to all the third party .NET libraries and tools. It runs on most platforms, including Linux and smart phones (via Mono).
</p>
<p>
Finally, it is well integrated with Visual Studio, which means you get a great IDE with IntelliSense support, a debugger, and many plug-ins for unit tests, source control, and other development tasks. Or on Linux, you can use the MonoDevelop IDE instead.
</p>

	</div>

    <div class="span4" style="float:left;">
{% highlight fsharp %}
// impure code when needed
let mutable counter = 0

// create C# compatible classes and interfaces
type IEnumerator<'a> = 
    abstract member Current : 'a
    abstract MoveNext : unit -> bool 

// extension methods
type System.Int32 with
    member this.IsEven = this % 2 = 0

let i=20
if i.IsEven then printfn "'%i' is even" i
	
// UI code
open System.Windows.Forms 
let form = new Form(Width= 400, Height = 300, 
   Visible = true, Text = "Hello World") 
form.TopMost <- true
form.Click.Add (fun args-> printfn "clicked!")
form.Show()
{% endhighlight %}

The following series of posts demonstrates each of these F# benefits, using standalone snippets of F# code (and often with C# code for comparison).
